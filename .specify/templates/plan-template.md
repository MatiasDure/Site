# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [e.g., library/cli/web-service/mobile-app/compiler/desktop-app or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

| Gate | Principle | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| All new pages are statically pre-renderable (no per-request server logic) | I. Static-First | ☐ |
| No `any` types; `strict: true` remains enabled in tsconfig.json | II. TypeScript Strict Mode | ☐ |
| All styling uses TailwindCSS utility classes; no new CSS files outside globals.css | III. TailwindCSS for All Styling | ☐ |
| `"use client"` used only where browser APIs / stateful hooks are strictly required | IV. Server Components by Default | ☐ |
| Semantic HTML used; images go via `<Image>`; interactive elements are keyboard-accessible | V. Accessibility & Performance | ☐ |
| No new third-party packages added without documented justification | Technology Stack | ☐ |
| Names are descriptive; components have a single responsibility; no commented-out code | VI. Readability, Clarity & Architecture | ☐ |
| Magic values are extracted into descriptive constants files instead of floating in components | VI. Readability, Clarity & Architecture | ☐ |
| No premature abstractions; new abstractions justified by 3+ repetitions | VI. Readability, Clarity & Architecture | ☐ |
| If multi-agent task distribution is requested, `specs/[###-feature-name]/task-distribution.md` exists and dispatcher/worker workflow docs will be followed | Multi-Agent Task Distribution | ☐ |

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
